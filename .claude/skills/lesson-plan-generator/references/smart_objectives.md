# SMART Learning Objectives Guide

## SMART Framework

### S - Specific
The objective clearly states what the learner will do, avoiding vague language.

**Poor**: Students will understand fractions
**Better**: Students will add fractions with unlike denominators

**Key Questions**:
- What exactly will learners do?
- What content or skill is targeted?
- Is the action verb specific enough?

### M - Measurable
The objective includes criteria that allow assessment of achievement.

**Poor**: Students will appreciate poetry
**Better**: Students will identify and explain at least three literary devices in a given poem

**Key Questions**:
- How will achievement be measured?
- What evidence demonstrates mastery?
- Can this be observed or assessed?

### A - Achievable
The objective is realistic given time, resources, and learner capabilities.

**Poor**: Students will master all aspects of cellular biology (in one lesson)
**Better**: Students will diagram and label the major organelles of a plant cell

**Key Questions**:
- Is this realistic for the time allocated?
- Do learners have prerequisite knowledge?
- Are necessary resources available?

### R - Relevant
The objective connects to broader learning goals and real-world application.

**Poor**: Students will memorize the periodic table
**Better**: Students will use the periodic table to predict chemical properties of elements

**Key Questions**:
- How does this connect to course goals?
- Why is this important for learners?
- What real-world application exists?

### T - Time-bound
The objective specifies when achievement is expected.

**Poor**: Students will eventually be able to write essays
**Better**: By the end of this lesson, students will write a five-paragraph argumentative essay

**Key Questions**:
- When should this be achieved?
- Is the timeframe explicit?
- Does it match lesson duration?

## Objective Writing Formula

**Template**: By the end of [time period], [learner] will be able to [action verb] [specific content] [measurable criteria].

### Examples by Subject Area

**Mathematics**:
- By the end of this lesson, students will be able to solve two-step linear equations with 90% accuracy on a 10-problem assessment.

**Science**:
- By the end of this lesson, students will be able to design a controlled experiment that isolates one independent variable, including hypothesis, materials, and procedure.

**English Language Arts**:
- By the end of this lesson, students will be able to construct a thesis statement that makes a clear, arguable claim supported by three distinct reasons.

**Social Studies**:
- By the end of this lesson, students will be able to analyze primary source documents to identify bias, perspective, and historical context using a provided analysis framework.

**Physical Education**:
- By the end of this lesson, students will be able to execute proper basketball shooting form, demonstrating correct hand placement, follow-through, and arc on 7 out of 10 attempts.

## Objective Quantity Guidelines

| Lesson Duration | Recommended Objectives |
|----------------|------------------------|
| 30-45 minutes  | 2-3 objectives         |
| 45-60 minutes  | 3-5 objectives         |
| 60-90 minutes  | 4-6 objectives         |
| 2+ hours       | 5-8 objectives         |

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing objectives, verify:
- [ ] Uses specific action verb from Bloom's taxonomy
- [ ] States exactly what learner will do (not teacher)
- [ ] Includes measurable criteria or conditions
- [ ] Achievable within lesson timeframe
- [ ] Connects to broader learning goals
- [ ] Explicitly time-bound ("By the end of...")
- [ ] Avoids compound objectives (one skill per objective)
- [ ] Progressive complexity (lower to higher order thinking)
