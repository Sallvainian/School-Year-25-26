# Classroom Management Guide: OpenSciEd Physical Science 8.1 Lesson 1
## Collision Phenomena Investigation

---

## 1. Room Setup and Material Management

### Pre-Class Setup (5 minutes before students arrive)
- **Label Areas**: Use large, colorful signs for areas A, B, C - tape to walls at eye level
- **Materials Station**: Set up central table with:
  - Stack of Investigation Handouts (pre-counted by class size + 2 extras)
  - Pencils in cups (one per table group)
  - Timer visible to all students
- **Notebook Corner**: Designate space for students who forgot notebooks
  - Keep 5-6 composition books as loaners
  - Simple checkout system: student name on sticky note

### Efficient Distribution Strategies
- **Handout Distribution**:
  - Assign one "Materials Manager" per table group before activity starts
  - Have managers collect handouts during the 30-second transition warning
  - Alternative: Place handouts face-down on tables during previous class
- **Notebook Management**:
  - Students keep notebooks on desks throughout lesson
  - No collection needed - just flip to new page for T-chart

### Quick Cleanup Procedures
- **2-Minute Rule**: All materials must be returnable within 2 minutes
- **Table Captains**: Rotate weekly responsibility for table organization
- **Pencil Collection**: Use magnetic strips on board - students place pencils there when done

## 2. Transition Techniques

### Activity 1 → Activity 2: Movement to Independent Work
**Timing: 30 seconds**
- **Signal**: Chime + raised hand
- **Instruction**: "When you hear the chime, return to your seat. You have 30 seconds to be seated with your notebook open to a fresh page."
- **Movement Flow**:
  - Area A students move first (closest to seats)
  - Areas B and C follow in order
  - Use visual countdown timer on board

### Activity 2 → Activity 3: Individual Handout Work
**Timing: 45 seconds**
- **Pre-transition**: "In 1 minute, you'll get your investigation handout. Finish your current thought."
- **Materials Managers**: Send one student per table to get handouts
- **Clear Expectations**: "When you receive your handout, begin reading the directions silently."

### Activity 3 → Activity 4: Scientists Circle Formation
**Timing: 2 minutes**
- **Pre-signal**: "In 2 minutes, we'll form our Scientists Circle. Start finishing your thoughts."
- **Formation Strategy**:
  - Use tape marks on floor in circle shape (set up once, use all year)
  - Students bring only notebook and pencil
  - Assign "Circle Captain" to help with spacing

### Universal Transition Signals
- **Attention Signal**: Chime + "Give me 5" (5 fingers up = 5 seconds to attention)
- **Movement Signal**: "Transition time starts... now!" + start visible timer
- **Ready Signal**: Thumbs up when ready for next instruction

## 3. Behavior Management

### During Independent Work (Activities 2 & 3)
**Engagement Strategies:**
- **Silent Start**: First 2 minutes are completely silent to establish focus
- **Proximity Management**: Circulate every 30 seconds during silent work
- **Checkpoint Questions**:
  - "Show me your T-chart heading"
  - "Point to where you're writing your model explanation"
- **Early Finisher Protocol**:
  - "If done early, add more details to your drawings"
  - "Review and improve your explanations"

**Managing Off-Task Behaviors:**
- **Redirect, Don't Correct**: "I see you're thinking about X. How does that connect to collisions?"
- **Private Proximity**: Stand near off-task student, continue instruction
- **Choice-Based Refocus**: "Would you like to work on the drawing or the explanation first?"

### Scientists Circle Dynamics
**Setup for Success:**
- **Circle Agreements**:
  - One voice (only person with talking stick speaks)
  - Listen to understand, not to respond
  - Build on others' ideas with "I agree because..." or "I respectfully think..."
- **Participation Strategies**:
  - **Think-Pair-Share**: 30 seconds think, 30 seconds pair discussion, then circle sharing
  - **Popcorn Style**: Students call on each other, not teacher
  - **Pass Option**: "I pass for now" is always acceptable

**Managing Dominant/Shy Personalities:**
- **Talking Stick Rule**: Physical object (ruler, foam ball) = speaking permission
- **Equal Voice**: "We've heard from this side of circle. Let's hear from the other side."
- **Written First**: Have students write their thought before sharing verbally

## 4. Time Management

### Pacing Strategies by Segment

**Activity 1: Share and Compare (7 minutes)**
- **Minutes 1-2**: Students move to areas and discuss
- **Minutes 3-5**: Quick reports from each area (60 seconds each)
- **Minutes 6-7**: Transition setup for next activity
- **Pacing Tip**: Use visual timer - when it hits 2 minutes, call for area reports

**Activity 2: Notebooks and T-Chart (6 minutes)**
- **Minutes 1-2**: Set up T-chart headers and format
- **Minutes 3-5**: Fill in observations and questions
- **Minute 6**: Share one observation with table partner
- **Pacing Tip**: "You should have at least 3 items in each column by minute 4"

**Activity 3: Initial Models (12 minutes)**
- **Minutes 1-3**: Read directions and start drawing
- **Minutes 4-8**: Create and refine model drawings
- **Minutes 9-11**: Write explanations of models
- **Minute 12**: Final review and cleanup
- **Pacing Tip**: Announce "halfway point" at minute 6

**Activity 4: Scientists Circle (Flexible timing)**
- **Start with 10 minutes minimum**
- **Can extend if rich discussion emerges**
- **Can compress if other activities ran long**

### What to Cut if Running Behind
**Priority Cuts (in order):**
1. Reduce Scientists Circle to 8 minutes
2. Skip table partner sharing in Activity 2
3. Reduce model explanation writing time by 2 minutes
4. Combine area reports in Activity 1 (all three areas report simultaneously)

### Extension Activities if Ahead
**Quick Extensions:**
1. **Gallery Walk**: Students view 3-4 other models quietly
2. **One New Question**: Add one more question to T-chart based on model creation
3. **Partner Model Review**: Compare models with table partner
4. **Collision Prediction**: "What would happen if we changed one thing about this collision?"

## 5. Common Challenges and Solutions

### Students Struggling with Concepts

**Challenge**: "I don't know what to draw for my model"
- **Solution**:
  - Provide sentence starters: "Before the collision, the objects were..."
  - Show basic shapes example: "Your drawing can use simple circles and arrows"
  - Pair with confident partner for 2-minute brainstorm

**Challenge**: "I don't understand what caused the collision"
- **Solution**:
  - Redirect to observable: "What do you see happening right before they hit?"
  - Use gesture: "Show me with your hands what the objects were doing"
  - Connect to experience: "Think about when you've seen things bump into each other"

### Group Dynamics Issues

**Challenge**: One student dominates area discussions
- **Solution**:
  - **Role Assignment**: "Each person shares one observation, then we rotate"
  - **Time Keeper**: Give each area a 2-minute timer
  - **Reporter Rotation**: Different person reports for each area

**Challenge**: Students off-topic during movement
- **Solution**:
  - **Purpose Reminder**: "Your job in Area A is to discuss the car video"
  - **Proximity Management**: Stand near chatty groups
  - **Refocus Question**: "What's one thing you noticed about the collision?"

### Material Distribution Bottlenecks

**Challenge**: Long lines at materials station
- **Solution**:
  - **Table Managers**: Only 1 person per table gets materials
  - **Staged Distribution**: Place materials on tables before class
  - **Multiple Stations**: Use 2-3 smaller distribution points

**Challenge**: Students don't have pencils
- **Solution**:
  - **Table Supply**: Keep pencil cup at each table group
  - **Entry Routine**: Check for pencil during daily greeting
  - **Loaner System**: Golf pencils in jar - quick grab and go

**Challenge**: Notebooks forgotten
- **Solution**:
  - **Digital Option**: Use classroom tablets for T-chart creation
  - **Paper Alternative**: Pre-made T-chart handouts as backup
  - **Buddy System**: Pair with student who has notebook
