## THUMBS UP/DOWN CHECKS

### Quick Understanding Checks
**Use throughout lesson for instant feedback**

**Check 1**: "Thumbs up if you can identify at least two things that affect how objects collide"

**Check 2**: "Thumbs up if your T-chart has examples in both columns"

**Check 3**: "Thumbs up if your model shows what happens DURING a collision, not just before and after"

**Check 4**: "Thumbs up if you can predict what would happen if we used different balls"

**Check 5**: "Thumbs up if you can explain your thinking using evidence from today's experiments"

### Processing Signals
**Teach students these hand signals for continuous feedback**

👍 **Thumbs Up**: I understand and I'm ready to move on
🤷 **Flat Hand**: I'm getting it but need a little more time
👎 **Thumbs Down**: I'm confused and need help
✋ **Stop Sign**: I have a question before we continue
👂 **Ear**: I'm listening but not ready to participate yet

## PARTNER ASSESSMENT STRATEGIES

### T-Chart Partner Review
**Time**: 5 minutes after T-chart creation
```
PARTNER ASSESSMENT PROTOCOL

Your Name: _____________ Partner's Name: _____________

1. Look at your partner's T-chart for 2 minutes without talking

2. Give feedback using these prompts:

GLOWS (Things done well):
□ "I like how you organized..."
□ "Your observation about... is really detailed"
□ "You included an example I didn't think of..."

GROWS (Suggestions for improvement):
□ "You might add..."
□ "I wonder if you noticed..."
□ "Have you considered..."

3. Switch roles and repeat

4. Together, create one new observation to add to both charts
```

### Model Sharing Protocol
**Time**: 8 minutes after individual model creation
```
PARTNER MODEL EXCHANGE

Step 1 (2 min): Partner A explains their model
Partner B listens and asks ONE clarifying question

Step 2 (2 min): Partner B explains their model
Partner A listens and asks ONE clarifying question

Step 3 (2 min): Find similarities
"Our models both show..."
"We both think..."

Step 4 (2 min): Find differences
"Your model shows... while mine shows..."
"I included... but you included..."

Step 5: Together, write one question both models leave unanswered
```

### Peer Feedback Cards

## PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION TIPS

### Time-Saving Strategies

**Prep Once, Use Multiple Times**:
- Laminate observation sheets for reuse
- Create template forms in Google Docs
- Develop signal systems students learn once
- Design general rubrics adaptable to multiple activities

**Efficient Data Collection**:
- Use smartphone camera to capture student work quickly
- Audio record student explanations during work time
- Take photos of T-charts before erasing for reference
- Use class lists with checkboxes for quick notation

### Student Training for Self-Assessment

**Week 1**: Introduce self-assessment language and expectations
**Week 2**: Model how to use rubrics and reflection questions
**Week 3**: Practice peer feedback with structured protocols
**Week 4**: Students begin choosing appropriate assessment tools

### Making Assessment Actionable

**Daily**: Review exit tickets to plan tomorrow's opening
**Weekly**: Analyze patterns to group students for support
**Unit**: Use formative evidence to prepare summative assessments
**Ongoing**: Celebrate growth and adjust instruction continuously
