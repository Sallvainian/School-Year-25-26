# OpenSciEd Physical Science 8.1 Lesson 1
## Discussion Prompts and Questioning Techniques for Collisions

### Overview
This resource provides comprehensive questioning strategies to facilitate student discovery of collision patterns, damage factors, and initial model development. Questions are organized by purpose and include suggested wait times to promote deeper thinking.

---

## 1. Opening Questions - Hook Students' Curiosity
*Purpose: Activate prior knowledge and generate interest*
*Wait Time: 10-15 seconds after each question*

### General Opening Prompts
- "What do you think happens the moment before, during, and after two objects crash into each other?"
- "If you could slow down a collision to see it frame by frame, what would you expect to see?"
- "What's the most dramatic collision you've ever witnessed? What made it so memorable?"
- "Why do you think some collisions cause more damage than others?"

### Video Analysis Openers
- "As we watch these collision videos, what patterns do you notice that seem to repeat?"
- "What questions pop into your mind as you observe these crashes?"
- "If you had to predict the outcome of the next collision, what would you look for first?"

---

## 2. T-Chart Development Questions
*Purpose: Guide systematic observation and categorization*
*Wait Time: 20-30 seconds for observation, 15 seconds for explanations*

### Pattern Recognition
- "Looking at our collision videos, what similarities do you notice between collisions that cause a lot of damage?"
- "What do collisions with minimal damage have in common?"
- "How might we organize these observations into categories that make sense?"

### Specific T-Chart Prompts
**Left Side (More Damage):**
- "What characteristics do you see in collisions where objects break apart or deform significantly?"
- "Describe the motion you observe just before high-damage collisions occur."

**Right Side (Less Damage):**
- "What patterns emerge in collisions where objects bounce off each other relatively intact?"
- "How do low-damage collisions differ in the way objects move afterward?"

### T-Chart Refinement
- "Looking at your T-chart, which observations seem most important for predicting damage?"
- "Are there any patterns that don't fit neatly into either category? How might we handle those?"

## 3. Probing Questions - Deepen Understanding of Collision Factors
*Purpose: Explore variables that affect collision outcomes*
*Wait Time: 15-20 seconds*

### Speed/Velocity Factors
- "How do you think the speed of the moving object affects the collision outcome?"
- "Would the damage be different if both objects were moving toward each other versus one hitting a stationary object? Why?"
- "What evidence from our observations supports your thinking about speed?"

### Mass/Size Factors
- "How might the size or mass of the colliding objects influence what happens?"
- "If a small object hits a large object versus a large object hitting a small one, would you expect the same result? Explain your reasoning."
- "What real-world examples can you think of where size/mass clearly affects collision damage?"

### Material Properties
- "Why might two objects made of different materials behave differently in a collision?"
- "How do you think the hardness or flexibility of materials affects collision outcomes?"
- "What role might the shape of objects play in collision damage?"

### Direction and Angle
- "Does it matter if objects hit head-on versus at an angle? What evidence supports your thinking?"
- "How might a glancing blow differ from a direct hit?"

---

## 4. Collision Type-Specific Questions

### Type A: Moving Object Hits Stationary Object
*Wait Time: 15 seconds*

- "When you see a moving object about to hit a stationary one, what factors help you predict what will happen next?"
- "Why do you think the stationary object sometimes moves a lot after being hit, and sometimes barely moves at all?"
- "What determines whether the moving object bounces back, stops, or continues moving?"

### Type B: Stationary Object Gets Hit
*Wait Time: 15 seconds*

- "How does the experience differ for the object that was just sitting there versus the one that was moving?"
- "What determines how far the previously stationary object will travel after being hit?"
- "Why might some stationary objects tip over while others slide or roll?"

### Type C: Two Moving Objects Collide
*Wait Time: 20 seconds*

- "When two moving objects collide, how do you predict which direction each will go afterward?"
- "What's different about this type of collision compared to when only one object was moving?"
- "How might the relative speeds of the two objects affect the outcome?"

---

## 5. Socratic Questions - Guide Discovery of Patterns
*Purpose: Lead students to construct understanding through questioning*
*Wait Time: 20-30 seconds*

### Cause and Effect Exploration
- "What do you think causes some objects to bounce while others stick together or break apart?"
- "If damage occurs during a collision, what must be happening to the objects involved?"
- "What evidence tells us that something transfers from one object to another during a collision?"

### Pattern Generalization
- "Based on all our observations, what general rules might govern how collisions work?"
- "If you had to teach someone else to predict collision outcomes, what would be the most important things to tell them?"
- "How confident are you in these patterns? What would make you more certain?"

### Model Development
- "If you had to draw a simple diagram showing what happens during a collision, what would be the key elements to include?"
- "How might we represent the before, during, and after stages of a collision?"
- "What would a scientist need to measure to understand collisions better?"

## 6. Assessment Questions - Check for Understanding
*Purpose: Monitor student comprehension and identify misconceptions*
*Wait Time: 10-15 seconds*

### Quick Checks
- "In your own words, describe what makes one collision more damaging than another."
- "Give me a thumbs up if you can predict which collision will cause more damage, thumbs down if you're still unsure."
- "What's one thing about collisions that surprised you today?"

### Application Questions
- "If I told you two cars were about to collide, what three questions would you ask to predict the damage?"
- "How would you design a collision to cause minimal damage? Maximum damage?"
- "What safety features in cars might relate to what we've learned about collisions?"

### Misconception Probes
- "Some people think heavier objects always cause more damage in collisions. What would you say to that?"
- "Is it possible for a collision to happen where no damage occurs? Explain your thinking."
- "Do you think the damage is always equal for both objects in a collision? Why or why not?"

*Wait Time: 30+ seconds*

### Real-World Connections
- "How might engineers use our collision patterns when designing safer vehicles?"
- "What collision principles might apply to sports like football or hockey?"
- "How do you think these patterns scale up to very large objects like planets or scale down to very small ones like atoms?"

### Design Challenges
- "If you were designing a protective device for a fragile object, how would you use what we've learned?"
- "How might understanding collisions help in designing better sports equipment?"
- "What questions about collisions do we still need to investigate?"

### System Thinking
- "How might the surface that objects collide on affect the outcome?"
- "What role does the environment (air, water, etc.) play in collisions?"
- "Are there collisions happening around us right now that we can't see? What might those look like?"

### Differentiation Notes
- Provide sentence stems for English language learners
- Offer visual supports for abstract concepts
- Allow multiple ways to express thinking (verbal, written, drawn)
- Pair students strategically for peer discussions
