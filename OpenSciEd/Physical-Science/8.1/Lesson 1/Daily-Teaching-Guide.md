## 📋 **Activity-by-Activity Guide**

### **1️⃣ Share and Compare Related Phenomena (7 minutes)**

**Opening Hook** (1 minute):
> "Who's been in a collision this week? Walking into a door? Bumping someone in the hallway?"

**Collision Types Review** (2 minutes):
- **Type A**: Moving object hits stationary (car hits pole)
- **Type B**: Stationary object gets hit (pole gets hit by car)
- **Type C**: Two moving objects collide (two cars crash)

**Movement Activity** (4 minutes):
1. "Check your RED damage card - which type is it?"
2. Students move to labeled areas
3. Partner share protocol:
   - Partner 1 shares (30 seconds)
   - Partner 2 compares (30 seconds)
   - Identify one similarity together
4. Repeat with GREEN no-damage cards

**Key Questions to Ask**:
- "What patterns are you noticing?"
- "Why might similar collisions have different outcomes?"
- "What factor seems most important?"

**🚨 Watch For**:
- Students confused about collision types → Quick reteach with hand gestures
- Off-task conversations → Redirect with specific comparison prompts

---

### **2️⃣ Set Up Notebooks and T-Chart Creation (6 minutes)**

**Transition** (30 seconds):
> "Return to seats in 3... 2... 1... Notebooks open to next blank page!"

**T-Chart Setup** (1.5 minutes):
```
Patterns in Collisions | Factors/Variables for Damage
______________________|_________________________
                      |
```

**Independent Work** (4 minutes):
- Students record observations from partner discussions
- You circulate and prompt thinking:
  - "What about the speed of objects?"
  - "How might mass matter?"
  - "Consider the materials involved..."

**Expected Student Responses**:
✅ Good Understanding:
- Speed differences
- Mass/weight of objects
- Material types (hard vs soft)
- Direction of movement

⚠️ Misconceptions to Address:
- "Bigger always causes more damage" → Ask about foam vs metal
- "Only moving objects cause damage" → Reference earthquake damage

**Quick Assessment**:
- Thumbs up/middle/down for confidence
- Note students needing support for modeling

---

### **3️⃣ Create Initial Models (12 minutes)**

**Setup & Distribution** (2 minutes):
- Pass out both handouts simultaneously (use helpers)
- Clear instructions on slide:
  1. Choose collision from poster
  2. Draw Time Point 1 (objects touching)
  3. Draw Time Point 2 (split second after)
  4. Explain what happened between points

**Modeling Support Script**:
> "Imagine you have super slow-motion video. What would you see at the exact moment of contact? That's Time Point 1. Now, what happens a split second later? That's Time Point 2."

**Individual Work Time** (8 minutes):

**Differentiation in Action**:
- **Struggling Students**: Provide sentence starters
  - "At contact, I see..."
  - "After impact, the objects..."
- **Advanced Students**: Add challenge
  - "Include force arrows"
  - "Show particle-level changes"

**Circulation Priorities**:
1. Check all students have selected a collision
2. Support struggling students with sketching
3. Push advanced students for deeper representation
4. Document interesting models for sharing

**Collection** (2 minutes):
- 2-minute warning announcement
- Collect both handouts for formative assessment
- Preview Scientists Circle formation

---

### **4️⃣ Scientists Circle Discussion (12 minutes)**

**Formation** (2 minutes):
- "Bring your notebook and pencil to the circle"
- Use numbered spots for quick seating
- Establish discussion norms reminder

**Discussion Structure**:

**Round 1: Model Sharing** (4 minutes)
- Speaking token protocol
- Each student shares one element from model
- No repeats - must add new idea

**Round 2: Pattern Finding** (4 minutes)
- "What did multiple models have in common?"
- Chart patterns on visible board
- Connect to T-chart factors

**Round 3: Questions & Wonderings** (4 minutes)
- "What questions do our models raise?"
- Record for future investigation
- Preview next lesson's exploration

**Facilitation Moves**:
- **Revoicing**: "So you're saying speed matters because..."
- **Pressing**: "What evidence supports that?"
- **Connecting**: "How does that relate to Maria's point?"
- **Wait Time**: Count to 5 after questions

## 🎯 **Assessment Checkpoints**

### **Quick Formative Checks**:

| Activity | Look For | Red Flags | Quick Fix |
|----------|----------|-----------|-----------|
| T-Chart | Multiple factors listed | Single factor only | Partner share for ideas |
| Model | Before/after representation | No change shown | Demo with hands |
| Discussion | Building on ideas | Silent/disengaged | Direct question with wait time |

### **Exit Ticket** (if time):
"Write one factor you think MOST affects collision damage and why"

---

## 🔧 **Common Issues & Solutions**

### **Problem**: Students confused about collision types
**Solution**: Use your body to demonstrate each type

### **Problem**: T-charts are sparse
**Solution**: Think-pair-share for 30 seconds, then add

### **Problem**: Models lack detail
**Solution**: "Add 3 labels to explain what's happening"

### **Problem**: Scientists Circle is silent
**Solution**: Start with partner talk, then share out

### **Problem**: Running behind schedule
**Priority Cuts**:
1. Shorten model time to 8 minutes
2. Skip one round of Scientists Circle
3. Assign exit ticket as homework

## 💡 **Differentiation Quick Guide**

**For ELL Students**:
- Provide word bank for T-chart
- Allow native language notes
- Partner with supportive peer

**For Advanced Students**:
- Add mathematical representations
- Consider molecular level
- Generate hypothesis for testing

**For Struggling Students**:
- Pre-draw T-chart template
- Provide collision examples
- Focus on 2-3 key factors

---

## 📊 **Success Indicators**

By end of lesson, students should:
- ✅ Identify 3+ factors affecting collision damage
- ✅ Create model showing change during collision
- ✅ Participate in scientific discussion
- ✅ Connect observations to patterns

---

## 🆘 **Emergency Protocols**

**If chaos erupts during movement**:
- Freeze signal → Silent standing → Reset with clear directions

**If models are way off track**:
- Quick whole-class demo with objects → Restart with guidance

**If discussion fails**:
- Switch to think-pair-share → Written responses → Gallery walk
