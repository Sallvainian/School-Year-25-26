## 1. FORMATIVE ASSESSMENT CHECKPOINTS

### Checkpoint A: Initial Collision Observations (10 minutes)
**When**: During ball drop activity setup
**Assessment Target**: Students can identify observable patterns in collisions

**Quick Check Protocol**:
- **Thumbs Assessment**: "Thumbs up if you notice the balls moving differently when they hit"
- **Think-Pair-Share**: 30 seconds individual thinking, 1 minute partner share
- **Exit Slip**: "One pattern I noticed was..."

**Evidence Collection**:
```
Pattern Recognition Tracker
□ Identifies change in motion
□ Notices different collision outcomes
□ Uses observation vocabulary
□ Asks investigable questions
```

### Checkpoint B: T-Chart Development (15 minutes)
**When**: After initial ball experiments, during T-chart creation
**Assessment Target**: Students organize observations and identify collision factors

**Observation Protocol**:
- **Gallery Walk**: 2 minutes to view 3 other T-charts
- **Peer Feedback**: "One strength I see... One question I have..."
- **Teacher Check-In**: Visit 4-5 groups using observation sheet

**Look-For Evidence**:
```
T-Chart Quality Indicators
EMERGING:
□ Lists basic observations (ball moved, made sound)
□ Focuses on obvious features (size, color)

DEVELOPING:
□ Categorizes observations logically
□ Identifies 2-3 collision factors
□ Uses some scientific vocabulary

PROFICIENT:
□ Clear categories with multiple examples
□ Identifies 4+ factors affecting collisions
□ Connects observations to patterns
□ Uses precise descriptive language
```

### Checkpoint C: Initial Model Creation (20 minutes)
**When**: During individual model drawing and explanation writing

```

### Checkpoint E: Scientists Circle Discussion (20 minutes)
**When**: During whole-class sharing and consensus building
**Assessment Target**: Students communicate scientific thinking and build on ideas

**Participation Assessment**:

## 2. LOOK-FORS DURING ACTIVITIES

### Observable Behaviors Indicating Understanding

**During Hands-On Investigation**:
✅ **Strong Evidence**:
- Systematically testing one variable at a time
- Recording observations with detail
- Making connections between trials
- Asking "what if" questions
- Using measurement vocabulary (harder, faster, bigger bounce)

✅ **Developing Evidence**:
- Following procedures consistently
- Noticing when something different happens
- Comparing results between attempts
- Beginning to use scientific terminology

⚠️ **Needs Support**:
- Random testing without purpose
- Focusing only on entertainment value
- Not recording observations
- Unable to describe what happened

### Red Flags for Misconceptions

**Common Physics Misconceptions to Watch For**:
```
❌ MISCONCEPTION: "Heavier objects always cause more damage"
✅ REDIRECT: Focus on speed and stopping distance observations

❌ MISCONCEPTION: "The ball bounces because it wants to get away"
✅ REDIRECT: Ask about what pushes the ball up

❌ MISCONCEPTION: "Only one object exerts force in a collision"
✅ REDIRECT: Use action-reaction examples from experience

❌ MISCONCEPTION: "Force is something objects have, not something they do"
✅ REDIRECT: Focus on pushes and pulls during collision
```

### Evidence of Scientific Thinking Development

**Progression Indicators**:

**Level 1 - Observation**:
- Names what they see happening
- Uses descriptive words
- Notices sequences of events

**Level 2 - Pattern Recognition**:
- Compares multiple trials
- Identifies consistent results
- Groups similar observations

**Level 3 - Causal Reasoning**:
- Connects cause with effect
- Predicts outcomes based on patterns
- Uses "if...then" thinking

**Level 4 - Model-Based Explanation**:
- Explains mechanisms behind observations
- Represents invisible forces
- Connects multiple variables

## 3. FEEDBACK STRATEGIES

### In-the-Moment Feedback Techniques

**Strategy 1: Questioning Prompts by Understanding Level**
```
FOR EMERGING UNDERSTANDING:
"What did you notice about how the balls moved?"
"Can you point to where the collision happened?"
"Which ball changed direction?"

FOR DEVELOPING UNDERSTANDING:
"How did the movement change when you tried different balls?"
"What do you think caused that difference?"
"Can you predict what would happen if...?"

FOR ADVANCING UNDERSTANDING:
"How could you represent the forces in your model?"
"What evidence supports that explanation?"
"How does this connect to other collisions you've seen?"
```

**Strategy 2: Validation and Extension**
```
VALIDATION STEMS:
"I notice you identified... That's important because..."
"Your observation about... shows scientific thinking because..."
"The way you organized... helps others understand..."

EXTENSION PROMPTS:
"Building on that idea, what if...?"
"That makes me wonder about..."
"How might that connect to...?"
```

### Written Feedback on Models

**Model Feedback Framework**:

**WHAT STUDENTS DID WELL** (Specific Strengths):
- "Your arrows clearly show the direction of movement"
- "You included what happens before AND after the collision"
- "Your labels help explain your thinking"

**NEXT STEPS** (Growth-Oriented):
- "Try adding arrows to show forces during the collision"
- "Consider what's happening inside the objects when they touch"
- "Think about representing the speed or strength of movement"

**QUESTIONS TO INVESTIGATE** (Curiosity Building):
- "What do you wonder about collisions between different materials?"
- "How might you test your prediction about...?"
- "What other evidence could support this idea?"

### Peer Feedback Structures

**Protocol 1: Gallery Walk Feedback**
```
Round 1 (3 minutes): OBSERVE
- Look at 3 different T-charts
- No talking, just observe patterns

Round 2 (5 minutes): APPRECIATE
- Share one strength from each T-chart
- Use sentence stem: "I appreciate how you..."

Round 3 (4 minutes): QUESTION
- Ask genuine questions about observations
- Use sentence stem: "I wonder about..."
```

**Protocol 2: Model Partner Exchange**
```
Step 1: Each student explains their model (2 minutes each)
Step 2: Partners identify one similarity and one difference
Step 3: Together, create one question their models don't answer
Step 4: Share question with another pair
```

### Self-Assessment Rubrics

**Student Self-Check: T-Chart Quality**
```
MY T-CHART SHOWS:
□ At least 5 different observations about collisions
□ Clear categories that make sense to others
□ Observations that come from our experiments
□ Ideas about what affects how collisions happen

NEXT TIME I WILL:
□ Add more detail to my observations
□ Include measurements when possible
□ Think about forces and energy
□ Make connections between different trials
```

**Student Self-Check: Model Development**
```
MY MODEL INCLUDES:
□ Objects before collision
□ Objects during collision
□ Objects after collision
□ Labels that explain my thinking
□ Some representation of forces or energy

MY MODEL EXPLAINS:
□ What causes the collision to happen

```
