**Key Teaching Moment:** Establish consistent notebook organization for the unit

#### **8:30 - 12:00 | Stop and Jot - Collision Factors**
**Teacher Moves:**
- Prompt: "Based on what you observed in the phenomena, what factors do you think affect how objects interact during collisions?"
- Circulate and observe student thinking
- Encourage students to draw from prior experiences, not just the phenomena cards

**Student Actions:**
- Individual brainstorming in notebooks
- Create T-chart with factors that might affect collisions
- Consider both factors they can observe and factors they think might matter

**T-Chart Structure:**
```
Factors I Can Observe | Factors I Think Might Matter
---------------------|-----------------------------
Speed of objects     | Mass of objects
Size/shape          | Materials (hard/soft)
Direction           | Force applied
```

#### **12:00 - 13:00 | Partner Share**
**Teacher Moves:**
- "Turn to a partner and share what you wrote. Add any new ideas to your list."
- Listen for emerging patterns in student thinking
- Prepare to use student ideas in transition to modeling

**Student Actions:**
- Share T-chart with partner
- Add new ideas from partner discussion
- Refine thinking about collision factors

**Transition Cue:** "Your thinking about factors will help you create models of how collisions work."

### ACTIVITY 3: Create Initial Models
**Time:** 13:00 - 25:00 (12 minutes)

#### **13:00 - 14:30 | Distribute Materials and Set Expectations**
**Teacher Moves:**
- Distribute Initial Model handouts (one per student)
- Display modeling success criteria:
  * Shows objects before, during, and after collision
  * Includes factors you think are important
  * Uses labels, arrows, or other representations to show your thinking
- "Your model should show how you think collisions work based on everything we've discussed."

**Student Actions:**
- Receive Initial Model handouts
- Review success criteria
- Begin planning their model approach

**Material Distribution:** Ensure each student has handout and access to drawing materials

#### **14:30 - 22:00 | Individual Modeling Time**
**Teacher Moves:**
- Circulate with intentional observation protocol
- Ask process questions: "What are you showing in this part?" "How does this connect to the factors you identified?"
- Avoid correcting models; focus on understanding student thinking
- Take notes on common ideas and misconceptions for Scientists Circle

**Student Actions:**
- Create individual models showing collision process
- Include factors from their T-charts
- Use drawings, labels, arrows to represent their understanding
- May reference phenomena cards for specific examples

**Key Teaching Moments:**
- Notice how students represent forces, energy, or motion
- Observe which factors students prioritize in their models
- Document interesting model approaches for sharing

#### **22:00 - 25:00 | Model Gallery Walk Preparation**
