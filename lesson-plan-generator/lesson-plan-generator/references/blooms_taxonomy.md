# Bloom's Taxonomy Reference

## Cognitive Domain Hierarchy (Revised)

### Level 1: Remember (Foundation)
**Definition**: Retrieve relevant knowledge from long-term memory

**Action Verbs**: define, duplicate, list, memorize, recall, repeat, reproduce, state, identify, name, recognize, retrieve

**Example Objectives**:
- List the steps of the scientific method
- Define key vocabulary terms
- Recall the dates of major historical events

### Level 2: Understand
**Definition**: Construct meaning from instructional messages

**Action Verbs**: classify, describe, discuss, explain, identify, locate, recognize, report, select, translate, paraphrase, summarize, interpret, compare, contrast, exemplify

**Example Objectives**:
- Explain the concept of photosynthesis in own words
- Summarize the main argument of a text
- Compare and contrast two historical periods

### Level 3: Apply
**Definition**: Carry out or use a procedure in a given situation

**Action Verbs**: execute, implement, solve, use, demonstrate, interpret, operate, schedule, sketch, apply, calculate, construct, model, predict

**Example Objectives**:
- Solve quadratic equations using the quadratic formula
- Apply grammar rules to construct complex sentences
- Use statistical methods to analyze data sets

### Level 4: Analyze
**Definition**: Break material into constituent parts and determine relationships

**Action Verbs**: differentiate, organize, relate, compare, contrast, distinguish, examine, experiment, question, test, deconstruct, outline, attribute, integrate

**Example Objectives**:
- Analyze the rhetorical strategies in a speech
- Differentiate between correlation and causation
- Examine the structure of a chemical compound

### Level 5: Evaluate
**Definition**: Make judgments based on criteria and standards

**Action Verbs**: appraise, argue, defend, judge, select, support, value, critique, evaluate, justify, assess, prioritize, recommend, rate

**Example Objectives**:
- Evaluate the validity of a scientific claim
- Critique a peer's essay using a rubric
- Justify a proposed solution to a problem

### Level 6: Create (Highest)
**Definition**: Put elements together to form a coherent whole; reorganize into a new pattern

**Action Verbs**: design, assemble, construct, conjecture, develop, formulate, author, investigate, produce, plan, compose, generate, hypothesize, invent

**Example Objectives**:
- Design an experiment to test a hypothesis
- Create an original piece of persuasive writing
- Develop a business plan for a startup

## Using Bloom's Taxonomy in Lesson Planning

### Progressive Complexity
When designing lesson objectives, progress from lower-order thinking (Remember, Understand) to higher-order thinking (Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, Create). A well-designed lesson typically includes:

- 2-3 objectives at Remember/Understand level (foundational knowledge)
- 2-3 objectives at Apply/Analyze level (skill development)
- 1-2 objectives at Evaluate/Create level (advanced application)

### Alignment Checklist
- [ ] Each objective uses a specific action verb from the appropriate level
- [ ] Objectives are measurable and observable
- [ ] Activities and assessments align with objective levels
- [ ] Questions and exercises match the cognitive demand of objectives
- [ ] Scaffolding supports progression through levels

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
1. **Vague verbs**: "understand" or "know" without specifying how understanding is demonstrated
2. **Level mismatch**: Assessing at higher level than taught
3. **Skipping levels**: Jumping to Create without establishing foundation
4. **Overloading upper levels**: Too many high-level objectives for lesson duration
